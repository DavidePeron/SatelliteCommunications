In this section, the Link Budget for the Forward Path is computed.

In the first part, the parameters used in the calculation are presented and discussed, then is calculated the Link Budget for the Uplink (\gls{gs} to Satellite), the Downlink (Satellite to the user) and the overall one.
\subsection{Parameters setting and estimation}
	\subsubsection{Antenna Parameters}
		To compute the link budget we need the parameters of Satellite, Ground Station and User antennas. These are taken from \cite{ippolito17} and reported in \autoref{tab:antenna_param}.

		\begin{table}[h]
			\centering
			\begin{tabular}{ccc}
			\toprule
			& Symbol & Value\\
			\midrule
			\gls{gs} antenna diameter (m) & $d_{GS}$ & 6\\
			Sat antenna diameter (m) & $d_{SAT}$  & 1.2\\
			Sat antenna noise temperature (K)& $t_A^{SAT}$ & 290\\
			User antenna diameter (m)& $d_{US}$ & 1\\
			User antenna noise temperature (K)& $t_A^{US}$ & 80\\
			Antennas Efficiency & $\eta$ & 0.6\\
			\bottomrule
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Antennas parameters used in the Link Budget calculation}
			\label{tab:antenna_param}
		\end{table}

		$t_A^{SAT}$ is set to $290K$ since satellite receiver antenna \textit{sees} the full thermal radiation of the Earth, $t_A^{US}$ is set to $80K$ since typical values for a Ku-Band receiver antenna in the Downlink are between $60K$ and $80K$, and $80K$ is the value that most decrease the Link Budget.
		All the antenna's efficiencies are set to $0.6$, since typical values are between $0.6$ and $0.75$, so the worst case has been taken.

		Knowing the diameter of the antenna reflector, its efficiency and the wavelength of the communication, the gain of each antenna can be computed as in \autoref{eq:gain}.

		\begin{equation}\label{eq:gain}
			g = \eta\bigg(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}\bigg)^2 \qquad G = 10log\bigg[\eta\bigg(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}\bigg)^2\bigg] ~dBi
		\end{equation}

		The result for each antenna are in \autoref{tab:antenna_gain}.

		\begin{table}[h]
			\centering
			\begin{tabular}{ccc}
			\toprule
			& Symbol & Value\\
			\midrule
			\gls{gs} antenna gain (dB) & $G_{GS}^{TX}$ & 56.92\\
			Sat antenna gain while receiving (dB) & $G_{SAT}^{RX}$  & 42.94\\
			Sat antenna gain while transmitting (dB) & $G_{SAT}^{TX}$ & 40.68\\
			User antenna gain (dB) & $G_{US}^{RX}$ & 39.1\\
			\bottomrule
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Gain of each antenna in transmission and reception}
			\label{tab:antenna_gain}
		\end{table}

	\subsubsection{Losses}
		The losses due to noise and attenuation in the payload and some to atmospheric conditions are constant and are reported in \autoref{tab:constant_losses}. All the attenuations are in dB.

		\begin{table}[h]
			\centering
			\begin{tabular}{ccc}
			\toprule
			& Symbol & Value\\
			\midrule
			Input Backoff & $IBO$ & -16\\
			Output Backoff & $OBO$ & -10.47\\
			Losses due to multicarrier operation & $l_{mc}$ & 10.47\\
			Losses due to feeder & $l_{ftx}$  & 0.5\\
			Carrier to interference noise & $C/I$  & 23\\
			Pointing Loss & $l_p$ & 0.3\\
			Gases absorption & $l_{gas}$ & 0.3\\
			\bottomrule
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Constant losses}
			\label{tab:constant_losses}
		\end{table}
		Losses due to rain $L_{rain}$ and the Path Loss $L_{pl}$ depends on the position of the satellite and on the carrier frequency.

		For the GS we calculated a rain intensity $R = 11.4919  ~mm/h$, we assumed that the rain is 2km high and calculating the rain attenuation as in \autoref{eq:rain_formula} we obtain the plots in \autoref{fig:rain_up} and \autoref{fig:rain_down}.

		\begin{equation}\label{eq:rain_formula}
			L_{rain} = kR^\alpha L_sr_p
		\end{equation}

		\begin{figure}[ht]
			\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{up_rain.eps}
			\caption{Variation of rain losses in Uplink over the time}
			\label{fig:rain_up}
			\end{minipage}\hspace{0.5cm}
			\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}

			\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{down_rain.eps}
			\caption{Variation of rain losses in Downlink over the time}
			\label{fig:rain_down}
			\end{minipage}
		\end{figure}

		The parameters in \autoref{eq:rain_formula} are calculated as in \autoref{eq:rain_parameters}.
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:rain_parameters}
			\begin{split}
				k &= 4.21\times 10^{-5}\cdot f^{2.42}\\
				\alpha &= 1.41 \cdot f^{-0-0779}\\
				L_s &= \frac{2km}{sin\theta}\\
				r_p &= \frac{90}{90+4L_scos\theta}
			\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		where $f$ is the carrier frequency in Uplink or in Downlink and $\theta$ is the elevation angle.

		The path loss also depends on the position of the satellite and is calculated with the formula in \autoref{eq:path_loss}, where $r$ is the distance between the satellite and the \gls{gs} or the user, taking in account the altitude of the latter, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the communication.

		\begin{equation}\label{eq:path_loss}
			L_{PL} = 20log\bigg(\frac{2\pi r}{\lambda}\bigg) ~dB
		\end{equation}

		Using \autoref{eq:path_loss} in each istant of the simulation, we obtain the plots in \autoref{fig:up_pathloss} and \autoref{fig:down_pathloss}.

			\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}

			\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{up_pathloss.eps}
			\caption{Variation of Path Loss in Uplink over the time}

	\subsubsection{Effective Isotropic Radiated Power(EIRP)}
	To calculate \gls{eirp} we have to compute firstly the power that each antenna has to transmit $p_{tx}$.
	The power that each transponder has to transmit is calculated as in \autoref{eq:power_1T}, using the parameters yet defined, than this power has to be multiplied for the number of transponder in the system, that in our case is 12, the final formula is in
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:power_1T}
		p_{tx}^{1T} = [p_{HPA}]_{dB} - l_{mc} - l_{ftx}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:power_tot}
		p_{tx} = p_{tx}^{1T} + 10log(12)
	\end{equation}
	Then the \gls{eirp} is calculated for Uplink and Downlink with the formula in \autoref{eq:eirp}.
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:eirp}
		EIRP = G_{tx} + p_{tx}
	\end{equation}
	For the Uplink, using $G_{GS}^{TX}$ as gain, the result is $EIRP_{GS} = 96.79 ~dB$, while for the Downlink, using $G_{SAT}^{TX}$ as gain, the result is $EIRP_{SAT} = 66.58 ~dB$.
\subsection{Uplink}
	The Uplink link budget is calculated as in \autoref{eq:up_link}.
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:up_link}
		\begin{split}
			\bigg(\frac{C}{N}\bigg)_U &= EIRP_{gs} - IBO - L_U + \bigg(\frac{G}{T}\bigg)_{sat} - [k]_{dB} - B_{IF}\\
			&and\\
			L_U &= L_{PL} + L_{rain} + L_{pointing} + L_{gas}
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	Where $EIRP_{gs}$ is the \gls{eirp} trasmitted by the \gls{gs}, $(G/T)_{sat}$ is the \textit{Gain-over-Temperature} ratio of the satellite, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $B_{IF}$ is the Intermodulation frequency bandwidth, that in our case is simply the Carrier Symbol Rate $R_S$.
	$R_S$ is calculated as $R_B/4$ since we are using a 16APSK modulation that uses 4 bit per symbol ($bit ~per ~symbol = log_2(16) = 4$).

	$(G/T)_{sat}$ is computed as the difference (in dB) between the gain of the receiving antenna and the system temperature $T_S$.

	This last one is computed with the Friis' formula as in \autoref{eq:t_system}, and it gives a temperature of $T_S = 733.95K$, that corresponds to a $(G/T)_{sat}$ equal to $14.28dB$.
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:t_system}
		T_S = T_A^{SAT} + t_{LNA} + \frac{T_{CABLE}}{G_{LNA}} + \frac{T_{DC}}{G_{LNA}\cdot G_{CABLE}}
	\end{equation}
\subsection{Downlink}
	The Downlink link budget is calculated as in \autoref{eq:down_link}.
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
			\bigg(\frac{C}{N}\bigg)_U &= EIRP_{down} - OBO - L_D + \bigg(\frac{G}{T}\bigg)_{user} - [k]_{dB} - B_{IF}\\
	&and\\
			L_D &= L_{PL} + L_{rain} + L_{pointing} + L_{gas}
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:down_link}
	\end{equation}
	In that equation $EIRP_{down}$ is the \gls{eirp} trasmitted by the gateway and $(G/T)_{sat}$ is the \textit{Gain-over-Temperature} ratio of the user. $k$ and $B_{IF}$ remain the same values we also used for the Uplink link budget, while $L_D$ now represents the losses in the downlink segment.

	$(G/T)_{user}$ is computed as the difference (in dB) between the gain of the receiving antenna and the ground station system temperature $T_{gs}$, as it was for the Uplink case, but this time the Friis formula involves a different antenna temperature. In fact now we are dealing with the user station antenna and this is the reason of the element $T_A^{USER}$ in \autoref{eq:friis}. The formula brings to a user station temperature value of $T_{gs} = 523.94 K$ and a corresponding value for the user figure of merit of $\bigg(\frac{G}{T}\bigg)_{user} = 11.91$ dB

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:friis}
		T_{gs} = T_A^{USER} + t_{LNA} + \frac{T_{CABLE}}{G_{LNA}} + \frac{T_{DC}}{G_{LNA}\cdot G_{CABLE}}
	\end{equation}
\subsection{Overall Link Budget}
Once we calculate the Uplink link budget and the Downlink one, we have to put them together to find the overall link budget with the formula in \autoref{eq:link_budget_formula}, where $C/IM$ is the \textit{carrier-to-intermodulation} noise and in this project is put to $23dB$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:link_budget_formula}
	\bigg(\frac{C}{N}\bigg)_{TOT} = \bigg[\bigg(\frac{C}{N}\bigg)^{-1}_U + \bigg(\frac{C}{N}\bigg)^{-1}_D + \bigg(\frac{C}{IM}\bigg)^{-1}\bigg]^{-1}
\end{equation}

The plots of the Link Budget in function of the time (in the simulation) are in	\autoref{fig:CN_rain} and \autoref{fig:CN_no_rain}.

To ensure a good communication, the $E_s/N_0$ required by the modulation has to be lower then the actual link budget, so we define a quantity called \textit{Link Margin}, defined as in \autoref{eq:link_margin}, that has to be greater than 0. The $E_s/N_0$ required by a 16APSK 8/15-L is $6.55dB$, as stated in \cite{dvbs2x}.

The plots of the Link Budget in function of the time are in	\autoref{fig:lm_rain} and \autoref{fig:lm_no_rain}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:link_margin}
	Link ~Margin = \bigg(\frac{C}{N}\bigg)_{TOT} - \bigg(\frac{E_S}{N_0}\bigg)_{16APSK ~8/15-L}
\end{equation}
