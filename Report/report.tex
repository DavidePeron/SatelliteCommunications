\section{Problem Description} \label{sec:problem_description}
	\input{problem_description.tex}

\section{Simulator and Orbits} \label{sec:orbit}
	To guarantee the service required in \autoref{sec:problem_description}, different orbits have been taken in account.
	The most used orbit to ensure a stable and reliable satellite communication is Geostationary.
	\autoref{fig:GEOCoverage} has been taken from the Inmarsat's Website, and it shows as a \gls{geo} satellite can not reach the latitudes over $75^\circ$. For this reason a \gls{geo} does not fit our purpose.

	\glspl{leo} has been discarded since the time of visibility for a single satellite is very low, so an high number of satellites and an accurate tracking system are required to ensure a continuous service.

	\glspl{meo} suffer the same problems of \glspl{leo} ones, with the addition of the proximity to the Van Allen Belt where signal degradation increases significantly.

	The most suitable solution for our problem is an \gls{heo}, in particular we chose to analyse \textit{Tundra} and \textit{Molniya} orbits.

	To analyse the behavior of these orbits, an orbital simulator has been implemented using \textsc{Matlab}.
	The simulator architecture and its results are reported in \autoref{sec:simulator}.

\section{Cost Estimation}
	\input{cost.tex}

Through the considerations we have made in the previous sections we can state that around $180$ Millions of dollars ($151.793.055$ \euro \cri{verifica il prezzo}) are needed for the launch: in fact each spacecraft has a total mass of about \cri{mettere massa} and the Molniya orbit is a HEO orbit; moreover, since the raans of the two orbital planes are separated of 180 $\deg$ it is necessary to use two separate launchers, one for each spacecraft.\\

Through this analysis the total cost for the project is:
\begin{equation}
Cost_{Total} = Cost_{Launch} + Cost_{Spacecraft} = \cri{Mettere costo finale} \text{\euro}
\end{equation}

\section{Final considerations and conclusions}
	With this work we intended to present a communication system aimed to service the polar regions over Europe and Russia. From the previous sections the values and parameters found permitted us to establish the reliability and the feasibility of our system in terms of cost and weight. From our calculations we obtained a relatively simple system which needs 2 satellites and one ground station to supply our purpose and guarantees continuous coverage of the interested zones, moreover the link budget analysis provides us satisfactory values for the communication link, at the same time requiring a not so power-costly technology (see the modulation choice or the power for the \gls{hpa} based on worst case analysis). Finally, the cost analysis outlines a project which could represent a typical market solution, even though the one presented here is just a first proposal and it could be refined with more time and a comparison to other approaches.
