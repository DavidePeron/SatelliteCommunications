\section{Problem Description} \label{sec:problem_description}
	\input{problem_description.tex}

\section{Simulator and Orbits} \label{sec:orbit}
	To guarantee the service required in \autoref{sec:problem_description}, different orbits were taken into account, including the Geostationary orbit, since it is the most used one to ensure a stable and reliable satellite communication.
	Anyway, \autoref{fig:GEOCoverage} was taken from the Inmarsat's Website and shows that a \gls{geo} satellite can not reach the latitudes over $75^\circ$. For this reason we can conclude that \gls{geo} does not fit our purpose.

	Another orbit to discard is \glspl{leo}, since the time of visibility for a single satellite is very low and so an high number of satellites and an accurate tracking system are required to ensure a continuous service.

	Also \glspl{meo} suffers the same problems of \glspl{leo} ones and furthermore is in the proximity of the Van Allen Belt, where signal degradation increases significantly.

	From this analysis we concluded that the most suitable solution for our problem is an \gls{heo} orbit, in particular we focused on \textit{Tundra} and \textit{Molniya} orbits.

	To analyse the behavior of these orbits, an orbital simulator has been implemented using \textsc{Matlab} and the simulator architecture and its results are reported in \autoref{sec:simulator}.

\section{Final considerations and conclusions}
	With this work we intended to present a communication system aimed to service the polar regions over Europe and Russia. From the previous sections the values and parameters found permitted us to establish the reliability and the feasibility of our system in terms of cost and weight. From our calculations we obtained a relatively simple system which needs 2 satellites and one ground station to supply our purpose and guarantees continuous coverage of the interested zones, moreover the link budget analysis provides us satisfactory values for the communication link, at the same time requiring a not so power-costly technology (see the modulation choice or the power for the \gls{hpa} based on worst case analysis). Finally, the cost analysis outlines a project which could represent a typical market solution, even though the one presented here is just a first proposal and it could be refined with more time and a comparison to other approaches.
